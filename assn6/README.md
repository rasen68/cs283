I've had a very busy last few weeks, being pretty much busy 24/7 with taking 20 credits and doing 20 hours of work each week, so I had to stay up a bit past midnight to complete this one (and I decided I didn't really have the bandwith to get it really thoroughly perfect beyond basic functionality...) I hope that just being a few hours late past midnight and still clearly, at least in student standard time, within the realm of Thursday, won't cause me to lose points :)
